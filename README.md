# Ping Pong Game - Java
This is a Ping Pong Game I programmed for my ICS4U Final Project! I used Java GUI as well as some physics to help program this!

The blue player used the keys W and S to move up and down, respectively. The red player uses the up and down arrows to move up and down respectively. As the game progresses, the speed of the ball increases.
